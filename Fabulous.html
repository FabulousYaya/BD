				قبلك كنت عايش وحيد و تايه و حالتي حاله
				<br>
				لحد ما شوفتك حبيتك قولت لازم أكلمك أو ابعت رساله
				<br>
				جمعت نفسي بعت رسالة و بدأت القصه و المشوار
				<br>
				كنت عارف إن حبي ليكي كان مش بإرادتي مش بالاختيار
				<br>
				رديتي و اتكلمنا و بقيت مش قادر اسيبك
				<br>
				بقا كل إللي عايزة إني ابقي قريب منك أو حبيبك
				<br>
				اعترفتلك بحبي بعد شهر من البداية
				<br>
				قولت أكيد مش بتحبني و هي دي النهاية
				<br>
				طلعتي بتحبيني و أنا كنت فرحان و مستغرب
				<br>
				بس كوني اعشقك و استناكي ترجعي ده كان اغرب
				<br>
				سألتيني ليه كل الحب ده رغم إننا مش متشابهين
				<br>
				قولت تشابه أو اختلاف مش هيفرق عشان أنا استنيتك سنين
				<br>
				قولتي إني منك ومن كلامك هزهق و أمل
				<br>
				قولتلك أنا حتي بعد ١٠٠ سنه حبي ليكي هيزيد مش هيقل
				<br>
				بستني منك رسالة أو مكالمة أو حتي رنه
				<br>
				ببقي قاعد سرحان في صوتك و بحس إنه حته من الجنه
				<br>
				بستني الوقت إللي تبعتي فيه تسألي أنا كويس ولا لا
				<br>
				بحكيلك و اقولك تعبان و مشتاقلك و عايز زقه
				<br>
				بتقولي تعال فحضنى لما اقولك أنا قلقان أو خايف
				<br>
				بتقولي كله هيبقي تمام.... أنا جنبك ولا إنت مش شايف
				<br>
				حتى بعد يوم طويل بتساعديني بإللي اتبقي من طاقتك
				<br>
				بنتكلم بالساعات بس بعد كل ده لما تمشي بفتقدك
				<br>
				ليه لما بتمشي ابتسامتي بتختفي
				<br>
				بتمشي بضحكتك و أنا نور حياتي بيطفي
				<br>
				مشيتي بس في لسة في قلبي و دماغي عايشه
				<br>
				الناس كلها لحبي ليكي بقت عارفه و شايفه
				<br>
				حاولت أبقى موجود جنبك أساعدك حتي لو اليوم بطوله
				<br>
				تقوليلي أعمل إللي فمصلحتك و اقولك مصالحي جنبك يغوروا
				<br>
				حتى بعد المشاكل و الإختلافات بضحك و أقول
				<br>
				إسمها فرح أكيد وقتي معاها كله فرحه مش هتزول
				<br>
				قاعد مستني اليوم إللي هشوفك فيه تآني بعيني
				<br>
				عايزك تاخديني في حضنك و بكل قوة تضميني
				<br>
				هقعد معاكي اضحك و أحس إني عايش من تاني
				<br>
				حياة من غير فرحه دي مش حياة بالنسبالي
				<br>
				مش عايز أحسن عايزك آنتي معايا
				<br>
				عشان بقيتي شمسي و قمري و كل سمايا

				يأما اسبح و أجيلك أو أحاول و أغرق فيه

				<br>
				و لو غرقت فمين غيرك هيلحقني و يداويني

				أول مرة أشوفك تفكيري وقف و كانت لحظه صفا
				<br>
				شوفتك حياتي نورها رجعلها بعد ما اطفي
				<br>
				قعدنا و حضنتك و من كتر الراحه جفني غفا
				<br>
				اخدتك في حضني و فرحت و حزني اختفي
				<br>
				و اديني قاعد بفكر و اكتب كلام عن إللي حصل يوميها
				<br>
				كانت ذكري حلوه و كل ثانيه بفكر فيها
				<br>
				كلام إيه إللي يقدر يوصف ما شوفتك بعد غياب
				<br>
				و انهي كلام يوصف راحتي و قلبي إللي بين ايديكي داب

				Love stories starts with a nice conversation or a look but mine started with a miracle after realizing that the stars and the galaxy aren’t the most beautiful things I saw..... it was you.
				One day I joined an English course because I was bored and wanted to meet new people or make new friends if I’m lucky. I walked through the door and I saw people talking to each other so I thought maybe I won’t be able to talk to them but of course I had to try, so I went in, had a seat, and waited for something to happen. It wasn’t long until the teacher started to ask question and that’s when I noticed how active, full of life, and amazing you are. You got all my attention the moment you started speaking and I kept listening to what you said until the very end. Shortly after that the group work started, I was working with a 23 years old 	girl who was very friendly and nice. I remember the subject perfectly, it was about money. I was looking in her eyes and talking like I’ve never been this free and she was nice enough to talk back, but still I was thinking about you. The session ended and I told myself maybe it is just a feeling and it will go away, but I was wrong. Session after session I got more fascinated by how active you are like wow she is good despite her young age. One day you didn’t show up and I was worried because you were the bright one but that day I knew that what I have towards you isn’t just a feeling and I can’t just let it go. I don’t remember how many times I wanted to talk to you or ask you to have a drink with me because I thought about that a lot and I felt the necessity of talking to you so I texted you on the 12th of August, two days after the course. I remember how I felt when I texted you, I was worried of you being annoyed or me not being good enough to impress you but screw that I was reckless and I had to talk to you. We talked for days and days but these are the most important things that happened. The first thing happened after 4 days of chatting, I told you that you might be my crush and I remember how I was worried because you took 10 minutes to reply and said that you were thinking about what I said and also said that I might be your crush. Superman was the first nickname you gave me, and snickers was the first nickname I gave you. I remember the times we worked together at the course, I remember when you called me “handsa” and laughed, I remember the chat we had in the last session, I remember the morning you called me babe, I remember your mood at you birthday and the gifts I got you, I remember the night you told me that you love me, I remember the day I told you that I love you, I remember how hard I tried to prove that I’m worthy of your love, I remember how I was always smiling and laughing when I was talking to you, I remember the times you cried after I told you how I feel, I remember all of that because every moment with you was and will be special for me.
				When I laid my eyes on you I realized that you are the angel who will save me and you are the one who will make feel better. I love you and every detail about you, I love your attitude, your jokes, your hair, your white skin, the way you laugh, the way you worry about me, how shy you get when you say that you love me, I love 	it when you call me babe or when you say that you missed me. I love waiting for you because I know that everything will be better when you come back. I love the way I feel when I think that after a long day I will come back to find you waiting for me with opened arms. I love it when we see each other in video call. I love it when I hear your voice because I know that both us are happy at that moment. I love how optimistic you and I see things despite everything. I love it when I hear your voice saying that you love me. I love it when you flirt with me In French. You got me melting in your love and your hands are the only thing that keeps me together.
				Your love is the only ocean I want to drown in. Your silk hands are the only thing I want to touch. Your lips are the only thing I want to touch my cheeks. Your arms are the only thing I want to wrap around my body. The warmth of your body is all I want to feel. Your voice is the only thing I want to hear. Your beauty is the only thing I want my eyes to see.
				I feel so happy and excited when I see your smiling face before hearing your voice. I feel sad when I have to leave you or when I feel like I am not loving or giving you enough. I spend everyday with you because you’re what turn bad into good and you turn good into perfect. You are the best artist I’ve ever seen because you colored my world and decorates its walls with happiness, optimism, love, and joy. All the love songs and poetry suddenly became about you, like these things described you so that I can recognize you no matter when or where I met you. You live in my heart and my mind. You are the first person I think about whenever I see something  Sweet. My biggest dreams are to go out with you and seeing you in my graduation party. I can feel you flowing through my veins, and I am addicted to your love and all your details. I can fight the whole world with one hand if you are holding the other.
				In the end, the story or how I feel might not be perfect because they can’t describe your perfection. My love for you isn’t limited by words, it goes further than that. Sorry if the story was short but I promise to tell you more when we talk. I wish you love the story and I wish you had fun reading it.
