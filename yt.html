		<p>1 YEAR TOGETHER!<br>Yessssss we are one year together, tho by the time you read this it will be one year and one month together but it was a heck of a year. I faced lots of things but all they have in common is you being next to me. My brain can remember everything starting 12th of September 2019 or even before that until this exact day, and I can tell you that it is a heck of a year…. I mean the fun, the sadness, the times we laughed, the times we met, the times we called, the times we challenged each other, the times we cried, and all the other times we had together. You know how I am sure this year is a good year for me? Because you told me it going to be one when we called had a video call in the end of 2019. Words won’t express my happiness or the value of this year but I am sure that can be expressed by the way I look at you or by how I keep my heart and mind a perfect place for us you to live at. I wrote those two speeches with tears in my eyes, tears of happiness and hope you don’t have some when you’re reading them in a public place because that will be really weird xD. Thanks for all the time we spend together, I really appreciate every second of it.
