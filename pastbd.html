			<p>On the 10th of september, 2019<br> You went to school, and I stayed home and started working on your birthday gifts.<br> The gifts were 2 drawings and a speech.<br> I couldn't think of other simple but valuable gifts but this year is different as you can see.<br> Hope this brings back happy memories and make new unforgettable ones. </p>

			<p>Last year after sending these two drawings I sent this speech. I sticked to what i wrote and tried my best to be honest and hopefully i achieved it all. Read it and tell me if I kept my word.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Happy birthday to you! today you start a new chapter in your life and I hope it is a good start. I can't promise you an easy, happy year, but I will surely try to make it like that. I am always by your side and will always do my best to help you, and I'm sure that you are by my side and you will always do your best to help me. if things went well, I'll be here after a year celebrating your birthday again, and if things didn't go well, then you will be a happy memory for me. A new chapter means a new start and I really wish you get a good finale for it. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>So was this a good finale?</p>
